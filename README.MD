# Coolblue interview
## Rahmetullah YiÄŸit

In this codebase I tried to build the assignment.

## Running Application:

Application requires PHP8 or higher, and need PDO and pdo-mysql extensions.

First, install dependencies via Composer. Main dependency is PHPUnit for tests.

Then, just like the example codebase this comes with a docker-compose setup. Provided you have docker installed, start the app with `docker-compose up`, after which you can access the "application" via `http://localhost:8080`.

Database schema has been provided at the *etc* folder

There are 3 routes:

Product Details: http://localhost:8080/product/572770

Product Insurance Fee: http://localhost:8080/product/insurance/572770

Product Type: http://localhost:8080/types/35

## Tests:

Tests depends on PHPUnit and dependencies can be installed via composer.

## Further Improvements:

To limit myself to 4 hours, I leave it at this point. If I continue improving this I would focus on:

- Better Error Handling
- Better handling of the response header and codes.
- Logging & Monitoring
- Security(Preventing SQL injection etc.)
- I also left a few comments for possible future improvements.
